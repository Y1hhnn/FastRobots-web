This site documents my journey through **Fast Robots (2026)** 🚀,  
including builds, experiments, failures, and weekly reflections.

# Hey! 👋

I am a third year Computer Science student with a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 
I am passionate about creating new ways of thinking, feeling and empowerment through robots and artificial intelligence. 
Outside of my academics, I am also an installation artist based in Shanghai.
